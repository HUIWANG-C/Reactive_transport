# Reactive transport modeling in unsaturated porous media
In this project, we study the reactive transport phenomenon using numerical modeling.   

## OpenFOAM
We first simulate the steady-state flow field within the porous media structure based on the OpenFOAM framework.

## OpenFOAM-based Particle Tracking (OFPT)
